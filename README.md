# jupiter-sample
Sample project to try [Junit5 Jupiter](https://junit.org/junit5/), along with google [auto-value](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) and [error-prone](http://errorprone.info/), instead of [checkers framework](https://checkerframework.org/).

It seems using [error-prone](http://errorprone.info/) might not be possible with checkers framework (using checkers plugin for IDE). 

At least, checkers is not yet compatible with Java 9.
